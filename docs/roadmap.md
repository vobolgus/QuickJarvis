 # Project Roadmap

 ## Overview
 This project is a Python-based voice assistant that integrates OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition, LMStudio's Gemma model for analysis, and Suno's Bark for text-to-speech. It provides a simple console interface to record audio, transcribe it, analyze the content, and play back synthesized responses.

 ## Phase 1: Foundation & Code Quality (Q2 2025) - Completed
 - Modularized the codebase into clear components (recording, transcription, analysis, TTS, playback, utils)
 - Introduced dependency management (requirements.txt)
 - Replaced print statements with Python's `logging` module and configurable log levels
 - Used context managers for file and audio stream handling
 - Added type hints and docstrings for code clarity

 ## Phase 2: CLI, Configuration & Quality Improvements (Q3 2025)
 - Add CLI support via `argparse` for runtime parameters (record duration, model IDs, API endpoints)
 - Implement configuration file support (YAML/JSON) and environment variable overrides
 - Write unit tests for each module using `pytest` and mock external dependencies
 - Set up continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting, testing, and formatting checks
 - Integrate `pre-commit` hooks with `black`, `flake8`, and `isort`
 - Add a `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files and artifacts (e.g., `*.wav`)
 - Provide guidelines for setting up a Python virtual environment

 ## Phase 3: Feature Enhancements (Q4 2025)
 - Enable streaming transcription for longer interactions.
 - Add multi-language support and configurable language detection.
 - Add conversation memory to retain context across multiple interactions.
 - Support custom models and voice presets via configuration.
 - Introduce advanced audio preprocessing (noise reduction, VAD).
 - Provide a REST or WebSocket API for remote control.

 ## Phase 4: Deployment & Distribution (Q1 2026)
 - Create a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup for easy deployment.
 - Package the application for PyPI for pip installation.
 - Offer a standalone CLI tool and optional GUI front-end.
 - Implement monitoring, metrics, and health checks for production use.

 ## Phase 5: Community & Extensibility (Beyond)
 - Develop a plugin architecture for custom model integrations and workflows.
 - Create detailed contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
 - Host community-driven model and voice preset marketplace.
 - Explore integration with third-party services (e.g., Slack, Discord, home automation).
