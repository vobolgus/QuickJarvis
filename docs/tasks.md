 # Project Task List

 ## Setup & Infrastructure
 - [ ] Create `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to pin dependencies.
 - [ ] Add a `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files and artifacts (e.g., `*.wav`).
 - [ ] Provide guidelines for setting up a Python virtual environment.

 ## Code Refactoring
 - [ ] Split `main.py` into dedicated modules:
   - `recording.py` (audio capture)
   - `transcription.py` (Whisper integration)
   - `analysis.py` (Gemma API calls)
   - `tts.py` (Bark integration)
   - `playback.py` (audio playback)
   - `utils.py` (common helpers)
 - [ ] Use context managers for file and audio stream handling.
 - [ ] Introduce type hints and comprehensive docstrings.
 - [ ] Replace direct `print` calls with the `logging` module and configurable verbosity.

 ## Configuration & CLI
 - [ ] Integrate `argparse` to expose options:
   - Recording duration
   - Model identifiers and versions
   - LMStudio API URL
   - Voice preset selection
 - [ ] Externalize settings to a YAML or JSON config file with environment variable overrides.

 ## Testing & CI/CD
 - [ ] Set up `pytest` and write unit tests for each module, mocking external services.
 - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and formatting workflows.
 - [ ] Add `pre-commit` hooks with `black`, `flake8`, and `isort` for code consistency.

 ## Documentation & Examples
 - [ ] Write a comprehensive `README.md` covering installation, configuration, and usage.
 - [ ] Provide example scripts and sample recordings.
 - [ ] Document environment variables and configuration file options.

 ## Packaging & Distribution
 - [ ] Add `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for packaging and PyPI distribution.
 - [ ] Publish a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup for containerized deployment.
 - [ ] Create a CLI entry point for `pip install` usage.

 ## Continuous Improvement
 - [ ] Implement real-time streaming transcription and analysis.
 - [ ] Add multi-language detection and support for additional languages.
 - [ ] Improve error handling with retry logic and user-friendly messages.
 - [ ] Explore a plugin system to enable community-driven extensions.
